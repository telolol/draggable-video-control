# ⏱️ Expo World Clock

A smooth, interactive world clock experience built with:

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)

This project lets you slide through time across multiple cities and watch each clock hand rotate in perfect sync — smooth, responsive, and fully UI-thread powered.
