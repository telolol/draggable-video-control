# ▶️ Draggable Video Controls

A smooth, interactive video player UI built with:

- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated)
- [expo-glass-effect](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/glass-effect)
- [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler)

This project features a draggable play button that reveals previous/next skip controls as you move it — powered fully on the UI thread for buttery animations.
